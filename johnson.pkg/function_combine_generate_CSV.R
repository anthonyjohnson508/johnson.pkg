#Function for the final project. 
#This function will be used to combine all data manipulations performed and output an excel spreadsheat (.csv).
#This function will be useful as it will allow me to create a new spreadsheet that can be used to make maps in ArcGIS.
#This would be useful for future data exploration and visualizations for publication.
#This function will combine data from function_reclassify and function_Kmeans_Cluster.
